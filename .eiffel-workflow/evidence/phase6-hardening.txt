## Adversarial Testing Complete

Test Suite: test_adversarial.e implemented with comprehensive edge cases

Tests Added (7 tests):
1. test_1d_system - Test minimal 1D ODE system
2. test_small_time_interval - Test very small time step (0.00001)
3. test_high_dimension_system - Test high-dimensional 10D system
4. test_zero_initial_condition - Test with zero initial condition
5. test_tight_tolerances - Test with tight tolerances (0.000001)
6. test_solution_curve_stress - Stress test: add 100 points to solution curve
7. test_curve_interpolation - Test interpolation at midpoint

Results: All 7 adversarial tests PASS

## Integration with Phase 5 Tests

Phase 5: 6 instantiation tests (all passing)
Phase 6: 7 adversarial/edge case tests (all passing)
Total: 13 tests all passing (100% pass rate)

## MML Contract Hardening
